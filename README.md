# Sudoku
Sudoku Webpage to help, solve, and teach with algorithms (naked and hidden n pairs, intersection, xwing)

This is just one html page under 1000 lines with javascript to test some algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles like human do.  I tried to keep things as simple as possible without any fancy javascript stuff.  I tried to focus on algorthms that people can use to solve a puzzle.  If anybody has more fun coding a Sudoko Puzzle that to solve one, I will be happy to know more about you.

This javascript program containt three majors functions to eliminate candidates:
1) findn: find naked and nidden n pair.  "n pair" here can be 2, 3, .. n number.
2) findblc: find block, line column that intersect.
3) findxwn: find xwing with n column/line, like swordfish and jelly fish.

I expect to add more strategie one day if people are interested.
