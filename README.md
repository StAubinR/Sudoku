# Sudoku
Sudoku Webpage to help, solve, and teach with algorithms (naked and hidden n pairs, intersection, xwing)

This is just one html page under 1000 lines with javascript to test some algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles like human do.  I tried to keep things as simple as possible without any fancy javascript stuff.  I tried to focus on algorthms that people can use to solve a puzzle.  If anybody has more fun coding a Sudoko Puzzle that to solve one, I will be happy to know more about you.

This javascript program containt three majors functions to eliminate candidates:
1) findn: find naked and hidden n pair.  "n pair" here can be 2, 3, .. n number.
2) findblc: find block, line column that intersect.
3) findxwn: find xwing with n column/line, like swordfish and jelly fish.

I expect to add more strategies one day if people are interested.

If you want to try this webpage, just click the html file, click raw at upper right and right click and save as.  Open your download and click the html file.  I do not know any easier way to do it.
